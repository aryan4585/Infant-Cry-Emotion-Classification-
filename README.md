# Infant Cry and Emotion Classification

## Overview

The **Infant Cry and Emotion Classification** project aims to recognize and classify infant cries and detect emotions from facial expressions using machine learning techniques. The project integrates a cry classification system with facial emotion detection to provide a comprehensive analysis of infant and emotional states.

## Features

- **Infant Cry Classification**: Utilizes a Support Vector Classification (SVC) model to classify different types of infant cries.
- **Emotion Detection**: Uses the DeepFace library to analyze and identify emotions from facial expressions in images or videos.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Features a PyQt5 interface for real-time prediction and interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `DeepFace` for emotion detection
  - `OpenCV` for image processing
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning
  - `joblib` for model serialization
  - `sounddevice` and `scipy` for audio recording (if applicable)
- **Interface**: PyQt5 for creating interactive web-based applications
